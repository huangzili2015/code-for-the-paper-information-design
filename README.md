# code-for-the-paper-information-design

This is the python code for the numerical simulation - generalized network section in the paper: Information Design for Transportation Network. When solving the information design SDP problem, we use the Mosek solver in cvxpy. The R_route_W_state.py is the simulation code for the R=3 and W=3 network, and plot_info_design_diff_network_size.ipynb is the simulation code for the general R routes and W states network. If you need to use the code, make sure to apply for an academic license from the Mosek website.
