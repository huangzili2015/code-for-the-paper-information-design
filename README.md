# code-for-the-paper-information-design

This is the python code for the numerical simulation - generalized network section in the paper: Information Design for the Freight Delivery Network with Heterogeneity under Bayes Correlated Equilibrium. When solving the information design SDP problem, we use the Mosek solver in cvxpy. If you need to use the code, make sure to apply for an academic license from the Mosek website.
